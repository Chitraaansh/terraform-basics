# ☁️ AWS EC2 + S3 Automation with Terraform

This Terraform project provisions:
- An **EC2 instance** (Ubuntu-based)
- An **S3 bucket** (with a file uploaded from local disk)
- A **secure IAM role** allowing the EC2 instance to download that file from the S3 bucket
- Boot-time **user_data** script to install AWS CLI on the EC2 and download the file
